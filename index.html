        <h1>Reggie</h1>

        <h2>Opening and Origins</h2>
        
        <p>Ever since the dawn of the new century, rumors have always spread of sightings of supposed otherworldly creature. 
            This became such a common occurance that a catch all term was created for it. These impossible creatures came to
            be known as "cryptids." However, despite a passionate community of believers who dedicate their lives in the search
            of these creatures, no real proof has been found.</p>

        <p>Except for <strong>one.</strong></p> <!-- Emphasis could be better -->
            <!-- Figure out a better sciency name-->

        <h2>Taxonomy and Discovery</h2>

        <p><em>Rehg. Elligatoridae</em> is the taxonomical name for what has come to be know as a "Reggie". The shorthand name Reggie was 
            an abbreviation of the initial consonant sounds used after researchers tired of using the full name. Lorem ipsum  dolor

        <h2>Phylogeny</h2>

        <p>Members of this branch family first arose in the late Cretaceous, about 100â€“65 million years ago. <em>Regonious</em> of the Upper 
            Penisula is the only known fossil, dating back to the Campanian era between 86 to 72 Mya. Following the split of Alligators and 
            caimans in North America during the late Cretaceous, a small group of alligators was isolated by the closure of the Isthmus of 
            Panama during the Neogene period, from about 23 to 2.58 Mya. This resulted in a divergent branch from alligators, which evolved 
            to accomidate the regions brutal winters. This has resulted in the development of a thin, scruffy layer of fur which coats its
            entire body.</p>
