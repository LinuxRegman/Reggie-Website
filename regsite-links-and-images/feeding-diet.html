                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                    <p>Reggis, despite their usual small stature and cute appearance, are aggressive eaters. While they descend from 
                        alligators, they have evolved into omnivores, yet retain their aggression when it comes to food. It is important 
                        to stay aware of this fact when feeding reggis.</p>

                    <h2>Digestion</h2>
                    <p>It is important to know what a reggi can and can't actually digest for your health as well as theres. A reggie in
                        its natural habitat will eat anything it comes across, inanimate or not. This makes it hard to distinguish what 
                        they are actually able to digest</p>

        <div class="eaten-list mid-color-change">
            <h2>Objects Consumed</h2>
            <p>When left alone, reggis have been observed to eat the following:</p>
            <div class="object-list">
                <div>Cloth objects, such as clothes or blankets</div>
                <div>Drywall and fiberglass insultation</div>
                <div>Cleaning chemicals and detergent</div>
                <div>Plastic objects and packaging</div>
            </div>
            <p>One important thing to note is that none of the above are considered edible. They will occasionally consume edible food, 
                although this is purely by accident. Because reggies are descendants of alligators, they can go a long time inbetween 
                meals without eatings. It is not recommended you let a reggie eat such objects, but it will happen.</p>
            <p>For specifics on what you should and should not feed reggi, see the section below.</p>

        <div class="generic-info-box">
            <h2 class="generic-underline">Healthy Foods</h2>
            <p>While reggi may not like them, these foods are the healthiest options. You may need to convince (or trick) them into eating the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carrots</li>
                <li>Bread ( Crust cut off )</li>
                <li>Corned beef</li>
                <li>Potatoes ( Ideally mashed )</li>
                <li>Cheerios</li>
                <li>Apples ( Must be pre sliced )</li>
                <li>Corn ( creamed )</li>
                <li>Fish food</li>
                <li>Shredded cheese ( From the bag )</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="generic-underline">Unhealthy Foods</h2>
            <p>These are reggi's favorite foods. By no means let him eat them. They will likely do so anyways when you leave for work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gummy worms ( or real worms )</li>
                <li>Fiberglass insulation</li>
                <li>Fruity pebbles</li>
                <li>Dust bunnies</li>
                <li>Spiders</li>
                <li>Candle wax</li>
                <li>Wires</li>
                <li>Tide pods</li>
                <li>Prescription medication</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These represent the most commonly eaten items by domesticated reggis. We ideally would take the time to document every item,
                but there are too many items to reasonably cover in one article. We advise you exercise your best judgement regarding any items
                that have not been covered.
