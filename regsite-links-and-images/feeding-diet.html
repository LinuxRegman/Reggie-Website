        <h2>FEEDING REGGIE / DIET AND FOOD</h2>
        <p class="title sub">Reggis are hungry creatures that will eat you out of house and home. That is, assuming Reggi doesn't literally eat it first!</p>

        <h2 class="topictitlehalf">Overview</h2>
        <p>Reggies, despite their usual small stature and cute appearance, are aggressive eaters. While they descend
            from alligators, they have evolved into omnivores, yet retain their aggression when it comes to food. It
            is important to stay aware of this fact when feeding reggies.</p>
    
        <h2 class="topictitlehalf">Diet</h2>
        <p>It is important to know what a reggie can and can't actually digest for your health as well as theres.
            A reggie in its natural habitat will eat anything it comes across, inanimate or not. This makes it hard
            to distinguish what they normally eat, as it is inconsistent.

            When left alone, reggies have been observed to eat the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Cloth objects, such as clothes or blankets</li>
            <li>Drywall and fiberglass insultation</li>
            <li>Cleaning chemicals and detergent</li>
            <li>Plastic objects and packaging</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One important thing to note is that none of the above are considered edible. They will occasionally consume
            edible food, although this is purely by accident. Because reggies are descendants of alligators, they can
            go a long time inbetween meals without eatings. It is not recommended you let a reggie eat such objects,
            but it will happen.</p>

        <h2>Food Preferences and Allergies</h2>
        <p>Further complicating a reggies diet is their allergies. Being carnivores, they have evolved to subsist
            primarily on meat. However, this is at odds with their non-ideal food preferences. While it's true that they eat 
            anything and everything, they will eat some "foods" more than others. This can make it confusing to determine
            whether it is the food they have recently eaten that is bothering the reggi, or if it is their allergies.</p>
