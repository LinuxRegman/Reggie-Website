                    <p>Ever since the dawn of the new century, rumors have always spread of sightings of supposed otherworldly creature. 
                        This became such a common occurance that a catch all term was created for it. These impossible creatures came to
                        be known as "cryptids." However, despite a passionate community of believers who dedicate their lives in the search
                        of these creatures, none has been proven to exist.</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy and Discovery</h2>
                <p><em>Rehg. Elligatoridae</em> is the taxonomical name for what has come to be know as a "Reggie". The shorthand name Reggie was 
                    an abbreviation of the initial consonant sounds used after researchers tired of using the full name. Reggies were first discovered in the Grand Rapids
                    sewer system, after reported sighting of a large, fuzzy alligator. First responders were suprised to find that the alligator like creature was not
                    aggressive, and infact was just stuck. Following this odd encounter, reports of smaller reggies spread throughout the state of Michigan, usually
                    around the edges of residential areas. The first researcher to catalogue their existance was one Samuella Weldounis, in her thesis <em>"The Hidden 
                    Sub-Species of Metropolitan Areas.</em>", published March 14th, 2016.</p>

                <h2>Phylogeny</h2>
                <p>Members of this branch family first arose in the late Cretaceous, about 100â€“65 million years ago. <em>Regonious</em> of the Upper 
                    Penisula is the only known fossil, dating back to the Campanian era between 86 to 72 Mya. Following the split of Alligators and 
                    caimans in North America during the late Cretaceous, a small group of alligators was isolated by the closure of the Isthmus of 
                    Panama during the Neogene period, from about 23 to 2.58 Mya. This resulted in a divergent branch from alligators, which evolved 
                    to accomidate the regions brutal winters. This has resulted in the development of a thin, scruffy layer of fur which coats its
                    entire body.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Description</h2>
                    <p class="section-body">An average adult reggies's weight and length is 0.5 lb and 1 ft, but in rare cases sometimes grow to 6 ft long and and weigh over
                        3 lbs. All reggies have a prominent thin layer of coarse, fuzzy fur that coats their entire bodies. Reggies fur is usually colored but some subspecies 
                        have been noted as darker shade of green. All reggies are noted for having a yellow underside, starting from their lower jaw and ending at their tail.
                        Their general shape and proportions are consistent with other north american alligators, but are more rounded, with far fewer jagged edges. Due to Their
                        recent discovery, an accurate age range cannot presently be determined. It has been estimated that they can live up to 80 to 90 years.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Habitat</h2>
                    <p class="section-body">Reggies were initially discovered in the midwest inside residental sewer systems and the outskirts of suburbs. This was typically 
                        around small nature preserves and freshwater ponds. Reggies in this environment assist plant diversity by shuffling soil allowing plant diversity. 
                        Roughly 60% of reggies still preoccupy these areas, but human exposure has resulted in the remainer relocating closer to human settlements. Initial
                        migrations of reggies were seen as a problem at worst, or a nuisance at best.</p>

                    <p class="section-body">Despite initial concerns, migrating reggies were found to be non aggressive and sociable. Of the few midwestern towns they still
                        occupy, they are treated similarly to small creatures such as squirrels.</p>
